# This upgrade was done by yuri930 in approx. the following steps
1. Upgrade node/npm to versions 10.15.0/6.7.02 respectively
2. Create a new project
```react-native init "Mobile-App"```
3. Copy files from RN.0.55 project base (current master)
4+ Quoted from chat: "Removed unnecessary libraries, remove react-native-awesome-font using react-native-vector-icon, and update libraries to latest."

*Recommended approach:*  
*1. Leave this one as a backup - just-in-case.*  
*2. Do a separate upgrade using git upgrade approach*
